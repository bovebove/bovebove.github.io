                                                In this course, I learn to use Structured Query Language (SQL) to extract and analyze data stored in databases. I first learn to extract data, join tables together, and perform aggregations. Then I learn to do more complex analysis and manipulations using
                                                subqueries, temp tables, and window functions. By the end of the course, I was be able to write efficient SQL queries to successfully handle a variety of data analysis tasks. <br>                                                You can learn more about this training there :
